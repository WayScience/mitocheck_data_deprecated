# 0. Preprocess Movies

## A. Quality Control

Mitosis movies were pre-preprocessed by Mitocheck in a two-step quality control procedure based on automatic and manual inspection of data (see [quality control](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fnature08869/MediaObjects/41586_2010_BFnature08869_MOESM58_ESM.pdf) section of original paper's methods for more details).
This step was applied before the movies were uploaded to IDR and thus the downloaded data only includes data that has been pre-preprocessed by MitoCheck.
